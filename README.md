FAQ

1. What is an open book exam?

Open-book exams allow you to take notes, texts or resource materials into an exam situation.

2. What will be covered in Part I, II, and III of the exam?

Part 1,2, and 3 mainly focus on the concept of Finite Difference and Finite Element method

3. Is there any calculation in the first 3 parts of the exam?

There is, but not a lot.

4. What should we focus on?

Part 4 is 55/100. So, you should focus on trying to work on this part to be able to pass the exam.
If you can 100% nail part IV, you will certainly pass the unit.
In my experience, most students perform very well (>80%) in Part I, II and III.

5. Are the solutions given for the FinalExam-Format?

No, the solutions are not given for the FinalExam-Format since the PDE is not given
Please have a look at the "FinalExercise" together with its solution "FinalExercise-Solution", if you want to do some practice.
The "FinalExam-Format" only give you the general idea of the format of the Final Exam.
